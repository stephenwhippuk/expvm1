- The job of the assembler is to read the op codes and work out which instructions it refers to
- An assembler program is split into DATA and CODE Sections, these symbols are reserved 
- addresses are usually defined using labels XXXX: (can be any length) 
- operations in Brackets represent offsets i.e. LDA AX, (HELLO + CX) means load data from the address referred to by HELLO offset by the value in CX
    only one dynamic term is allowed in the offset but we can have fixed values that the assembler can calculate e.g. (HELLO + 1 + CX)
    the assmembler knows the address of Hello, so it can calculate this + 1, CX cannot be avaluated so it dynamic
- The DB instruction can be used to conveninently define blocks in the data segment. 
    Strings can be defined using "" or '' symbols for exmaple 
        HELLO: DB "Hello World\n"
    Arrays can be defined using 
        ARRAY: DB [2, 3, 5 ,6 ,7]
    WOrd arrays can be defined using DW so
        ARRAY DW [1, 2, 4, 5, 635534]
    As makes sense the label is a pointer to the first byte, spaces are optional  
- these can be defined in DATA SEGMENT or they can be defined inline but the assembler should just add to the data segment in the binary failed
    so
        DATA
            HELLO: DB "HEllo WOrld\n"
        CODE
            LDA AX, HELLO

    is the same as 
        CODE
            LDA AX, DB "Hello World\n"
    these anonymous strings take up memory but cannot be accessed outside of the location they are referred in... only 1 copy exists 
    so if used in a sub routine for example its effectively a local static variable
- we can also use [] as shorthand for offsets

        DATA
            HELLO: DB "HEllo WOrld\n"
        CODE
            LDA AX, HELLO[1]

        gets the second byte of HELLO (zero-indexed, so [0] is first byte, [1] is second)
        its also possible to use registers here e.g., 
            LDA AX, HELLO[CX]
        
        The [] notation is purely syntactic sugar - HELLO[CX] is translated to (HELLO + CX) by the assembler
        Both forms are valid, but [] is more readable for array-style access that whilst () can have caluclations, only a seingle term should be present in [] blocks


- HEX values are prefixed by 0x, otherwise values are taken as decimal and the assembler to map to the approprate hex values and thus byte pattern

an example hello world program


CODE
    LDA DX, DB "Hello World" ; inline anonymous memory block (11 characters)
    LD CX, 0xB ; start CX at 11 (string length, for zero-indexed access use length-1)
LOOP:
    CMP CX, 0 ; compares against zero which sets the Z flag if true
    JPZ PRINT ; exit LOOP if zero flag is set
    DEC CX ; decrease the counter first (so we access [10], [9], ..., [0])
    LDA AX, DX[CX] ; load byte at DX+CX into AX
    PUSH AX ; push next byte to the stack
    JMP LOOP ; next loop iteration
PRINT:
    PUSHW 0x000B ; push length of the string as a word (11 characters)
    SYS 0x0011 ; system call 0x0011: print with new line
    HALT ; stop execution
