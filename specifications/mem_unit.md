# brief
- mem unit is a virtual memory manager
- it maps a 40 bit virtual memory space
- it is responsible for allocating and deallocating real memory to regions of this virtual space
- has 2 modes protected and unprotected 
- this space is primarilly allocated to contexts
- a context represents a contiguous virtual addess space that
- - is managed by an accessor type
- - has its own format and thus interface to the outside
- - actual physical memory is allocated as needed by mem unit
- - contexts must be created in unprotected mode 
- - each can have 32 bits of addressable space at most. 
- - contexts have an id that is used to retrieve the appropriate accessor as needed
