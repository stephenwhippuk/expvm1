This is a work in progress: currently 1.0.0 is functionally complete, but there are some issues. 

The VM is basically functional, a number of bugs are being worked out of the system
The Assembler is basically functional, there are some bugs in binary generation that are also being worked out of the system

DOcumentation contains a reasonable number of errors currently, as docs were autogenerated
