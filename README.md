# This is a work in progress: currently 1.0.0 is functionally complete, but there are some issues.

The repo is public for viewing, but it is currently very much subject to change and should be taken only as representative of the final system.

- The VM is basically functional, *a number of bugs are being worked out of the system*
- The Assembler is basically functional, *there are some bugs in binary generation that are also being worked out of the system*

- Documentation is there but needs a sigbification tidy up and also contains a reasonable number of errors currently, as docs were autogenerated
